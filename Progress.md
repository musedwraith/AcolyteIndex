1. Created a new React project named **Acolyte Index** using `create-react-app`.
2. Set up a custom **App.js** that fetches Dota 2 hero data from the OpenDota API, allows selecting a hero, and displays their stats (roles, win rate, pro pick rate, move speed).
3. Created a custom stylesheet **AppStyles.css** to style the app in a dark purple and pink "wraith" theme.
4. Ensured the dropdown remains functional by adjusting CSS.
5. Ran the app successfully on **http://localhost:3000**, showing a functional hero selector and themed interface.
